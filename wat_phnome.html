    <blockquote>“Buddhaṃ śaraṇaṃ gacchāmi. Dharmaṃ śaraṇaṃ gacchāmi. Sanghaṃ śaraṇaṃ gacchāmi.”</blockquote>
    <p>
      These holy verses of Buddhism echoes in one’s mind while visiting such a great temple of Buddha-Wat Phnom.
      Wat Phnom (Mountain Pagoda) is a sacred Buddhist pagoda located in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. It is the tallest religious structure in the city as it stands on a small hill. The pagoda was earlier known by the name of Wat Preah Chedey Borapaut.

      Location:
      Phnom Penh, Cambodia
      Denomination:
      Theravada Buddhism (a branch of Buddhism which follows the teachings of the Pali Canon)
      Founded:
      Built in 1373. The sanctuary was rebuilt several times in the 19th century and again in 1926.
      History: The legend of the founding of Wat Phnom tells of a local wealthy widow, named Lady Penh ( commonly referred as Daun Penh- Grandmother Penh- in Khmer) living at Chaktomuk, found a large koki tree in the river in 1373. Inside the tree she found four bronze statues of Buddha. Daun Penh began to build up a low mound of earth in the land close to her home and constructed it into a manmade hill. Eventually she constructed a small shrine on an artificial hill made with the help of the local people to protect the sacred statues.  With time this became a sacred site and sanctuary where people would make blessings and pray.  Thus, the name of the Capital of Cambodia came to be known as Phnom Penh- the Mountain of Daun Penh.
      Another account of the founding of the Wat suggests King Ponhea Yat (r. 1405-67), built the sanctuary (vihara) when he moved his capital from Angkor to Phnom Penh in 1422.
      King Ponhea Yat ordered His Excellency Decho Srei to raise the mount even higher when he finished building the new Royal Palace in the new city and constructed a sanctuary at the same place.  
        Style: The style used is Khmer style of architecture, having sloping roof and high gable, with designs having Khmer touch.
