        <h2>Who are we</h2>
        <p>
          The Rovers : An NGO founded to facilitate learning, exploring and experiencing different
          cultures and heritage. This organisation has been started with an initiative to educate
          students about the culture and heritage of India through the mode of study programmes
          and practical exposure. Our study programmes aspire to make ‘travel’, ‘learning’ and ‘living’
          parallel processes to stimulate growth in an individual & develop a sense of pride. We want
          to make travel a mode of education instead of leisure by engaging students in practical
          learning through individual activities & group workshops which bring out the best in each.
          <br>
          We have also expanded by initiating these tours into foreign nations to broaden the horizon
          of experience and exposure for students. After receiving positive reviews, we have decided
          to collaborate with universities abroad to provide a better learning atmosphere for the
          students participating in our programmes.
          <br>
          We also invite students and professionals with foreign nationalities to visit India and
          experience the rich culture of the vast, diverse and the oldest thriving civilization, with
          specially tailored programmes.
