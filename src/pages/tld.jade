            h2 TLD - Travel Learning and Documentation
         p Travel Learning and Documentation Programmes offers a unique opportunity to combine travel and learning, with a focus on various aspects of heritage and culture. Our programmes aim at combining theory with pragmatic experiences which would provide an exposure to the art, architecture, heritage and cultures of different regions, periods and styles. As an integral part of architectural education it will help introduce students to different avenues and openings in various fields of architecture like Architecture Journalism, Architectural Photography and Architectural Criticism. The students participating in the T.L.D. programmes will get numerous opportunities to interact and acquire skills from the Learning Societies operating worldwide, which will allow them to acquire better ideas about Architectural Documentation, Habitat Conservation, Building Restoration, Adaptive Reuse, Urban Redevelopment, etc. This initiative tends to encourage original and unorthodox approach towards experience education. Moreover, it is also a stepping stone which equips students, professionals of the design fraternity with awareness about the heritage and its conservation.
