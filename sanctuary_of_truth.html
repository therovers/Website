      Type of Architecture: The style of the sanctuary is in Khmer architecture. The images from Buddhist and Hindu religions and mythologies of Cambodia, China, India and Thailand are adopted in the Sanctuary of Truth. The building consists of four sections pointing in a cardinal direction and the sections are joined to a central core. The sculptures both inside and outside the sanctuary are a blend of Hindu, Khmer, Chinese (Taoist and Confucianism) and Thai influences. In this ‘Wooden Sanctuary’ all  parts emerging from its foundation are built of wood.    
      Overview: The Sanctuary of Truth is a gigantic wooden construction which covers the area of more than two rais by the sea at Rachavate Cape at the northern end of Pattaya
      Bay.  The huge teak building is 105 m high.
      The Philosophy of the Sanctuary of Truth:
      According to the official website, “The purposes of decoration with wooden carve sculptures are to use art and culture as the reflection of Ancient Vision of Earth, Ancient Knowledge, and Eastern Philosophy. With in this complex, visitors will understand Ancient Life, Human Responsibility, Basic Thought, Cycle of living, Life Relationship with Universe and Common Goal of Life toward Utopia.”
      "Only truth and goodness are immortal", is the real motive and essence of Sanctuary of Truth. The Sanctuary was based on truth and goodness drawn from religion, philosophy and art.
      The second half of the 20th Century until today, the world was under the influence of materialism and over-reliance on technology neglecting in the process traditional values, morality and spiritual contentment. Their attempts to control nature have transformed many people into egotistical individuals who are out to destroy one another through incessant wars and economic plundering.
      True happiness is found in intrinsic spiritual pleasure and not in materialistic pleasure. Ideals make human life more meaningful, determination to go to the ideal world is something desired by all men. Every belief, every religion and every philosophy leads there by difference paths.<center><img src="dist/assets/images/truth_3.jpg" width="600" height="400"/></center>

The four halls are linked to a Central Hall which stands for enlightenment or nirvana.

      On top of the four spires of the sanctuary, the four elements that will lead to the ideal world according to Eastern philosophy are presented. The four spires at the four corners of the roof symbolize religion, life, knowledge and peace. 
      -          Female celestial holding a book represents “The continuation of immortal philosophy, precept, morality and deed.”  - Male celestial (Deva) holding a lotus flower, represents “The establishment of religion (the pillar of the world)”.  - The celestial body holding a child and leading elderly , which represent life bestowed upon human beings ( To encourage scholar of the past and to create eternal Peace for all mankind through future).  - Female celestial with a pigeon perching on her hand and holding an ear of paddy , symbolizing Peace, Wealthy and Balancing World.

    <ul>
      <li><span> West Hall (1st hall /Origin)</span></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The West Hall symbolizes the creation of the universe where all things begin. The Universe created systems orbits and Earth. Earth planet composed with Great four elements - Earth, Water, Wind and Fire.  The façade of the West Hall has a distinct Hindu character. You will see sculpture of the Indra and the three-headed elephant Airawat . Four faced Brahman surmounts the transept of the front pavilion. Brahma is believed to be the creator of the world and He is one among the Trimurti.   The Hall holds Trimurti, the Trinity of Hindu Gods, Shiva (God of earth and fire- Beginning to end), Vishnu (God of water- Preserver) and Brahma (God of the sky and wind - creator of the universe). For this reason the tour of the sanctuary starts from the West Hall.
      Carved work show the Mahabhutas or the great four elements- earth, water, wind and fire. The gods who control these four elements are Brahma, Shiva and Vishnu.
      Shiva is shown on top of the Kailash Mountain. Shiva has third eye on his forehead and whenever he opens his third eye, everything burns and turns into dust. Vishnu rests on Ananta Nagaraj and above this, is the scultpture of Vishnu’s Viswaroopa (an episode of Srimad Bhagavat Gita).
      Brahma is shown on a swan.
      Buddhism believed all beings cause by Self-incidence spring element, mass, substance power and cause phenomenally (ignorance). It’s nature beginning to end.  Huge wooden Bodhisattava’s face represent the sublime states of mind virtues of leaders, are Love, Kindliness, Compassion, Sympathy and Equanimity. On top roof Bodhisattava step on Kilena and swan present the land great virtues monarchy.

    </ul>
    <P>
      The sculptures in the South Hall represent the sun, moon and the gods of the planets in the Solar System which influence the course of human life and events. The Sun causes day and night. The Moon causes tide. The planets move around the orbit.

    <ul>
      <li><span>East Hall (The 3rd hall)</span></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Wood sculptures on the pediment of Mahishasuramardini, an episode of Durga defeating Mahisa, symbolizes ignorance conquered by wisdom.
      Wood sculptures in the front gable are of parents, as the creators who give life to their offspring. Parental love is clean and pure. The Hall depicts Father and Mother who bring children into the world, who love, care and nurture their off-spring with the power and purity of parental love. Children in return respect and show gratitude to their parents.  The East Hall also promulgates these values.   "The physical and material deteriorate with time. Ideals give direction to life. Every belief, religion and philosophy leads to the same goal along different paths. Only Truth and Goodness are immortal. 
      Acquire knowledge, let wisdom conquer ignorance, live for humanity and create peace, these are goals great men strive for." 
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><span> North Hall (The 4th hall)</span></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The values promulgated here are – “good deeds and sacrifice free man from desires. Men though born under different circumstances can be released from the cycle of life by leading good lives and performing good deeds.  Those who sacrifice and suffer for their fellow-men yet decline enlightenment like Guan Yin are accorded the status of Bodhisattva." 
      Wood sculptures consist of Chinese supernatural beings, including the Bodhisattava (as viewed by Mahayana Buddhism). Mahayana Buddhism is called the large vehicle, that will carry people across the cycle of birth and death.
      Chinese concepts of Taoism and Confucianism pervade the North Hall. Guan Yin the Goddess of Mercy is present in several sculptures.   Bodhisatava is the one who will become enlightened and be Buddha, but declines to reach nirvana, wanting to save men from suffering first. His main attributes are love compassion, selflessness, sacrifice and his capacity for service to others is unlimited world. There are countless Bodhisatavas in Mahayana Buddhism, such as Bodhisatvalikotesavara (Kuan Yin), Bodhisatva Manyachusri. Although born under different circumstances, if they conduct good deeds and live good lives, men can be released from the cycle of karma.
      All the pillars have 8 sides, as 8 is considered as a lucky number in Chinese culture.

One can follow the Middle Way of self-conquest which leads to a complete cessation of suffering and sorrow, which is Nirvana, the ultimate goal of Buddhists. In Buddhism, the four kharmas of a Brahman include kindliness, benignity, rejoicing in others’ good fortune and equanimity.<center><img src="dist/assets/images/truth_6.jpg" width="600" height="400"/></center>
